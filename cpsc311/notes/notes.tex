\section{Lecture 2: Programming with Arbitrary-Arity Trees}
Review from CPSC 110

\textbf{Ron's shortcuts:}
\begin{quotation}
    In class you saw that after you have used the rest or the steps of the design recipe to build up your understanding of your problem, you can unleash that potential energy on your function templates, especially if you make use of Racket's keyboard shortcuts. Today I leaned heavily on:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item C-c C-o : the sexpression following the insertion point is put in place of its containing sexpression
        \item M-C-k : delete forward one S-expression
    \end{itemize}
\end{quotation}

\section{Lecture 3: Programming with PLAI Data Types and Abstract Functions}
We took a brief interlude to (re-)introduce abstract list functions, namely map and foldr. The map function takes a list and produces a same-length list whose contents are the result of applying some function to each element. This is a super-common operation.

foldr is a quite general way to operate on lists, though it is best used for simple-ish cases where it is easy to understand what the code is doing (you can write very hairy code using foldr: please don't!) . I explained foldr in a "declarative" fashion: in principle, (foldr for-cons for-empty lox) takes the list lox and replaces every instance of empty with for-empty, and every instance of cons with for-cons, and produces the result of evaluating that. I use the prefix for- here to imply "substitute this for xxx".
https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Fmap..rkt%29._andmap%29%29
\section{Lecture 4: The Gory Details of Parsing}
We also talked about some concepts of real-world parsing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item scanning/lexing turns lists of characters into lists of tokens. It loses whitespace information (how many spaces, how many line breaks, etc.) 
    \item parsing turns a list of tokens into a concrete syntax tree (aka parse tree) It is not lossy: you can recover the string of tokens from the tree.
    \item tree abstraction turns a concrete syntax tree into an abstract syntax tree. 
    \item It is lossy: it loses grouping token information (how many parentheses did you wrap around that??? i.e. "5 * (6 + 7)" is treated the same as" 5 * ((((6 + 7))))";
\end{itemize}
The final result is...a data structure in a data definition! That's where we want to be to write interpreters and other program-analyzing functions. However, to get there in this class, we will use a simpler toolchain than the one above, that depends on our using Racket-like syntax for our languages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item reading turns a string of characters into a symbolic expression (s-expression), a kind of tree
    \item parsing turns an s-expression representing a program into an abstract syntax tree, or signals an error if the s-expression does not represent a valid program.
\end{itemize}
This second sense of parsing (parsing รก la 311) is a little different than the general one, but we will still use the term because in a more general sense it's the same thing: turn some representation of programs into a tree that we can work with. We will cover this topic next class.

Parsing Gone Wrong: For an example of parsing gone wrong, you can see this post-mortem of the recent UK flight hiccup:

\section{Lecture 5: Parsing รก la 311: Symbolic Expressions and Frenz}
A naive way of designing a parser.
\begin{minted}{racket}
;; AEFS -> AE
;; produce an AE value corresponding to the given AE s-expression 
;; Effect: signals an error if the given s-expression does not represent an ae

;; AEFS (AE-focused s-expression) is one of:
;; - Number
;; - `{+ ,AEFS ,AEFS}
;; - `{- ,AEFS ,AEFS}
;; - <any other s-expression>
;; interp.  a symbolic expression, but with a focus on those that
;; represent AE expressions.

(define (parse sexp)
  (cond [(number? sexp) (num sexp)]
        [(and (list? sexp)
              (= (length sexp) 3)
              (symbol=? (first sexp) '+))
         (add (parse (second sexp))
              (parse (third sexp)))]
        [(and (list? sexp)
              (= (length sexp) 3)
              (symbol=? (first sexp) '-))
         (sub (parse (second sexp))
              (parse (third sexp)))]
        [else
         (error 'parse "bad AE")]))
\end{minted}

\subsection{Symbols, S-expressions and more}
Symbols are a very powerful design idea that McCarthy came up with, which allowed what you "symbolic AI" to use data definitions.

\begin{minted}{racket}
'hello ;; symbol
(quote hello) ;; or this
(symbol=? 'hello 'hi) ;; #f
(string->symbol "ma man!") ;; gives '|ma man!|
(define G1 (gensym))
> 'g262412
(symbol=? G1 'g262412) ;; #f
;; gensyms are never equal to any other symbol
\end{minted}

\marginnote{gensym returns an uninterned symbol}

\marginnote{Lisp is short for "list processinglanguage"}

\marginnote{Early on, every data definition in Lisp was just cons and symbols}

\begin{minted}{racket}
> (rest (cons 5 6))
. . rest: contract violation
  expected: (and/c list? (not/c empty?))
  given: '(5 . 6)
> (car (cons 5 6))
5
> (cdr (cons 5 6))
6
> (car (cdr (cons 5 (cons 6 (cons 7 empty)))))
6
> (cadr (cons 5 (cons 6 (cons 7 empty))))
6
> (cons? (cons 5 6))

;; quasiquotes - like quotations, but sometime not quote
> (quasiquote (5 . (6 . (7 . empty))))
'(5 6 7 . empty)
> (quasiquote (5 . (6 . (7 . (unquote empty)))))
'(5 6 7)
> (define L (list 8 9 10))
> (quasiquote (5 . (6 . (7 . (unquote L)))))
'(5 6 7 8 9 10)
> `(5 . 6 . 7 . ,L) ;; allows to eval expr inside quotes
    
\end{minted}


\section{Lecture 6: Parsing 2: Pattern Matching using match}
A neater way of implementing a parser: pattern matching!
\begin{minted}{racket}
;; Match-based template for AE
#;
(define (fn-for-aefs sexp)
  (match sexp
    [`,n #:when (number? n) (... n)]
    [`(+ ,sexp1 ,sexp2) (... (fn-for-aefs sexp1)
                             (fn-for-aefs sexp2))]
    [`(- ,sexp1 ,sexp2) (... (fn-for-aefs sexp1)
                             (fn-for-aefs sexp2))]
    [else (... sexp)]))

(define (parse sexp)
(match sexp
    [`,n #:when (number? n) (num n)]
    [`(+ ,sexp1 ,sexp2) (add (parse sexp1)
                            (parse sexp2))]
    [`(- ,sexp1 ,sexp2) (sub (parse sexp1)
                            (parse sexp2))]
    [else (error "bad AE:" sexp)]))
    
\end{minted}

\begin{minted}{racket}

'{+ 3 {- 7 {+ 3 1}}}

\end{minted}

\subsection{What is the WAE to success?}
We now define a new language \bold{WAE} which is really just the \bold{AE} language but with "with"!

\begin{minted}{racket}

'x  ;; x occurs free in this WAE expression
;; ERROR x is unbound

'{+ x y}
;; ERROR x is unbound

'{with {y 7} x} ;; x occurs free in this WAE expression
'{with {y x} y} ;; x occurs free in this WAE expression
'{with {x 7} {with {y x} z}} ;; x occurs bound, z occurs free, y is bound
;; but does not occur
\end{minted}

\subsection{How to step \bold{WAE} programs?}
\begin{minted}{racket}
;(define WAES3 '{with {x {+ 5 5}} {+ x x}})
'{with {x {+ 5 5}} {+ x x}}
'{with {x 10} {+ x x}} 
'{+ 10 10} ;; replace all "free" occurrences of x with the bound value
'20

;; "free" instance means that there isn't a surrounding "with"
\end{minted}

\section{Lecture 8: Free Identifier Instances}
\begin{minted}{racket}
    (define-type WAE     
        [num (n number?)]
        [add (lhs WAE?) (rhs WAE?)]
        [sub (lhs WAE?) (rhs WAE?)]
        [with (id symbol?) (named-expr WAE?) (body WAE?)]
        [id (name symbol?)])
;; interp.  program in the WAE language, corresponding to the following
;; Backus-Naur Form (BNF) specification 
;;   <WAE> ::= <num>
;;          | { + <WAE> <WAE> }
;;          | { - <WAE> <WAE> }
;;          | { with {<id> <WAE>} <WAE>}
;;          | <id>

;; Every AE program is a WAE program
(define AE1 (num 4))
(define AE2 (add AE1 (num 5)))
(define AE3 (sub (num 6) (num 3)))

;; WAE can associate identifiers with expressions
(define WAES1 '{with {x 4} x})
(define WAE1 (with 'x (num 4) (id 'x)))
(define WAES2 '{with {x 4} {+ x x}})
(define WAE2 (with 'x (num 4) (add (id 'x) (id 'x))))

\end{minted}

\subsection{Accumulators}
Accumulators are used to store some conetext when recursively traversing through a data structure. For eg. it could be used to store our current position in a list and make decision based on the position value. 

\mgraphics{graphics/2023-10-15-16-48-55.png}{The HtDF accumulator recipe}

The following function returns a list of all the free-instance identifiers from a WAE expression.

\begin{minted}{racket}
;; WAE -> (listof WaeID)
;; produce a list of the free identifier instances in the given expressions
;; (NOTE: since we want "instances" they need not be unique!)    
(define (free-instance-ids wae0)
;; Accumulator: binding-instances is (listof WaeID)
;; Invariant: all identifiers in wae0 with binding instances around wae
(local [(define (fn-for-wae wae binding-instances)
            (type-case WAE wae
            [num (n) empty]
            [add (l r) (append (fn-for-wae l binding-instances)
                                (fn-for-wae r binding-instances))]
            [sub (l r) (append (fn-for-wae l binding-instances)
                                (fn-for-wae r binding-instances))]
            [with (id named body)
                    (append (fn-for-wae named binding-instances)
                            (fn-for-wae body (cons id binding-instances)))]
            [id (x) (if (not (member x binding-instances))
                        (list x)
                        empty)]))]
    (fn-for-wae wae0 empty)))
\end{minted}

\section{Lecture 9: Substitution, Naรฏve and Capture-Avoiding }
\begin{minted}{racket}
;; subst: WAE symbol WAE -> WAE
;; substitutes second argument with third argument in the 
;; first argument. as per rules of substituition, the resulting
;; expression contains no free instances of the second argument

(define (subst expr sub-id val)
    (type-case WAE expr
        [num (n) expr]
        [add (l r) (add (subst l sub-id val)
                        (subst r sub-id val))]
        [sub (l r) (sub (subst l sub-id val)
                        (subst l sub-id val))]
        [with (bound-id named-expr bound-body)
            (if (symbol=? bound-id sub-id)) ;; means a nested `with` with same id
                (with bound-id
                      (subst named-expr sub-id val)
                      bound-body)
                (with bound-id
                      (subst named-expr sub-id val)
                      (subst bound-body sub-id val))]
        [id (v) (symbol=? v sub-id) val v]))
\end{minted}

This substituition function is really naรฏve in it's approach. Consider the following call to `subst`
\begin{minted}{racket}
(define EXPR (with (y 9) x))
(define WAE1 (with (x y) (with (y 3) (add x y))))
(subst EXPR x WAE1)
\end{minted}
The result of this call is 
\begin{minted}{racket}
(with (y 9) (with (x y) (with (y 3) (add x y))))
\end{minted}
Notice that in the second `with`, y is longer a free variable and is bound to 9 from the first with. In other words, this free instance has been "captured". In general, we want to ensure that when we are substituting free instances in a WAE expression with other WAE expressions, the free instances in the WAE being substituted in remain free. 

This is achieved by \textbf{capture-avoiding substitution}. This essentially involves renaming identifiers in a way such that substituted in free-identifiers are not captured and remain free. For example, continuing from the previous example, if we rename the first 'y' to 'g700', we will fix our problem.

\begin{minted}{racket}
    (with (g700 9) (with (x y) (with (y 3) (add x y))))  ;; now x, y remain free instances
\end{minted}

The following modification to our 'subst' function does exactly this. \footnote{Though, it is important to note that this version may rename identifiers even when it isn't necessary}

\begin{minted}{racket}
;; WAE symbol WAE -> WAE
;; substitute val for free instances of sub-id in expr, avoiding the capture
;; of any free identifier instances in wae2.
;(define (ca-subst expr sub-id wae2) (num 0)) ; stub
(define (ca-subst wae0 x0 wae1)
    (local [(define (fn-for-wae wae)
            (type-case WAE wae
                [num (n) (num n)]
                [add (l r) (add (fn-for-wae l)
                                (fn-for-wae r))]
                [sub (l r) (sub (fn-for-wae l)
                                (fn-for-wae r))]
                [with (x named body)
                    (let ([g (gensym)])
                    (with g  ;; notice we rename binding instance
                             ;; this ensures no clashes with our substitution
                          (fn-for-wae named)
                          (fn-for-wae (ca-subst body x (id g)))  
                [id (x) (if (symbol=? x x0)
                            wae1
                            (id x))]))]]
    (fn-for-wae wae0)))))    
\end{minted}

\subsection{Eager vs Lazy Reductions}
\fwgraphics{graphics/2023-10-15-17-24-57.png}{Eager vs Lazy reduction}

\section{Lecture 10: Environments and Environment-Passing Interpreters}
 
In practice substitution is expensive because it walks the entire program and reconstructs it every time an identifier is bound. Substitution provides a clear specification of program behaviour, and is a good implementation for a debugger or automatic stepper, but it's expensive for a real program implementation.

An environment, on the other hand, tends to be cheaper because adding to the environment is constant time and lookup can be pretty cheap too, compared to the lexical nesting depth of a typical program. So an environment is another example of an accumulator in action. Its invariant is what ensures that we produce the same final behaviour as substitution.

\begin{minted}{racket}
;; Env is Symbol -> Number
;; Effect: signals an error if a looked up identifier is not bound in the env
;; interp. a table for looking up identifier bindings

;; Env
(define empty-env
    (\lambda (x) (error 'lookup-env "Undefined identifier: ~a" x)))

;; Env Symbol Number -> Env
(define (extend-env env x0 n0)
    (\lambda (x)
    (if (symbol=? x x0)
        n0
        (env x))))

;; Env Symbol -> Number
;; look up x in env
;; Effect: signal an error if x is not in env
(define (lookup-env env x)
    (env x))
\end{minted}

This takes us back to the recurring theme: programs are data. Here we are using functions to implement a data structure.

\begin{minted}{racket}
;; Environment-passing interpreter

;; WAE -> Number
;; consumes a WAE and computes the corresponding number
;(define (interp/wae wae) 0) ; stub

(define (interp/wae-env wae0)
    ;; env is Env
    ;; Invariant: represents bindings (in inside-out order) of identifiers
    ;;            to values *due to pending substitutions*
    (local [(define (interp/wae-env wae env)
            (type-case WAE wae
                [num (n) n]
                [add (l r) (+ (interp/wae-env l env)
                            (interp/wae-env r env))]
                [sub (l r) (- (interp/wae-env l env)
                            (interp/wae-env r env))]
                [with (x named body)
                    (let ([vnamed (interp/wae-env named env)])
                        (interp/wae-env body
                                        (extend-env env x vnamed)))]
                [id (x) (with-handlers ([exn:fail?
                                        (ฮป (_)
                                            (error "Unbound identifier: ~a" x))])
                        (lookup-env env x))]))]
    (interp/wae-env wae0 empty-env)))
\end{minted}

In other words, store a map of identifiers and their eagerly evaluated values.



\section{Lecture 11:  First-Order Procedures/Functions, and a taste of Dynamic Scope}
\subsection{Stepping F1WAE Programs}
\begin{minted}{racket}

\end{minted}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{First-order functions:} Functions are not values in the language. They can only be defined in a designated portion of
    the program, where they must be given names for use in the remainder of the program. The functions
    in F1WAE are of this nature, which explains the 1 in the name of the language.
    \item \textbf{Higher-order functions:} Functions can return other functions as values.
    \item \textbf{First-class functions:} Functions are values with all the rights of other values. In particular, they can be supplied as the
    value of arguments to functions, returned by functions as answers, and stored in data structures.
\end{itemize}

The environment-based interpreter for the F1WAE language follows.
\begin{minted}{racket}
;; F1WAE (listof FunDef) -> Number
;; interpret the expression f1wae in the context of the fundefs
(define (interp-f1wae f1wae0 fundefs)

    ;;            *due to pending substitutions*
    (local [(define (interp-f1wae f1wae env)

\textbf{Dynamic Scoping:} Let's say that function x call function y in its body. In a dynamically scoped language, function y will have access to all the local variables defined in the body of function x (before the call to function y was made).

\textbf{De-sugar}-ing refers to adding features to a programming languages by definining it with existing features - so it gives syntatic sugar to use, but under the hood the implementation doesn't add anything new.

In our FFWAE language data-definition, we don't have a "with" since its equivalent to saying

\begin{minted}{racket}
    {with {x e1} {add e1 e2}} 
    ;; equivalent to
    {fun {x} {add x e2} e1}

We briefly talked about why someone might allow programs that we *know* could produce an error. There is a \texbf{robustness/correctness tradeoff} to consider, which has affected HTML's supremacy over XHTML, and may have motivated JavaScript's "keep-on-truckin'" behaviour in the face of undefined : better for some code to limp along half-working than to simply crash the moment something goes wrong.

So this explains why javascript is so weird. ew.

Today we focused on learning about exceptions, using a model of exception handling inspired by the OCaml programming language (https://ocaml.org/). For those not familiar with it, OCaml is a typed eager functional programming language that has many (but not all) of the niceties of Racket, but with static type checking and quite good performance. It is used at places like Facebook (who have also introduced a new surface syntax for OCaml called Reason (https://reasonml.github.io/)).

Effects affect the behaviour of every possible operation of your language (if your languge is structured such that operation can have effectful operands). Now, \textbf{order matters}. Make sure to use `let*` to enfore ordering in your interpreter (or nested `let`s).

\section{Lecture 22: Effect Abstractions 1 - Exceptions}
\mgraphics{graphics/2023-11-07-15-22-18.png}{He said "When a programming conept is understood informally, it would seem to be a trivial matter to invent a language notation for it. But in practice, this is hard to do. The main problem is to replace an intuitive, vague idea with a precise, unambiguous definition of its meaning and restrictions.}

Goal of this lecture is to use macros to encapsulate the complexity of addiing effectful features to a language.

Introducing effects means we impose a dependency order on our computations - it might matter if we evaluate left operand before the right or vice-versa for example. Similarly, when we introduced mutation, we had to evaluate the left operand first since it might update the store. Note that we imposed the order of the dependency, it could be that we decide the right operand is evaluated first and introduce a r->l dependency order.

\mgraphics{graphics/2023-11-07-20-24-39.png}{Lambda Man, this is lambda man outfit. He is one of the co-developers of Java generics. He took a lot of mathematical, theoritical abstractions and wrote papers that normal people could read. \textbf{Effect abstractions = Monads in Haskell}}

Hygienic macros
you need to macros to handle effects and not functions since racket is call-by-value and so it run the argument before passing it into the function -  no way to perform exception handling
non-strict languages dont have this issue - which is why haskell doesn't have a ood macro system

assignment in python is like letrec
